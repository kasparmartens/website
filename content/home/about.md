# About me

I am interested in **probabilistic Machine Learning** techniques with a focus on **healthcare and genomics** applications. 

I recently finished my PhD in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, as part of the [OxCSML](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) group in the Department of Statistics, where I was supervised by [Christopher Yau](http://cwcyau.github.io/) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). 
Upon graduation, I had an opportunity to share my time between [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (where I was a postdoctoral Research Fellow, a recipient of the *Turing-Crick Biomedical Data Science Award*) and **Apple  Health AI**. I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/) in Oxford. 

### Research interests

I have a broad interest in developing probabilistic machine learning methods (such as *Deep Generative Models*) with a focus on tackling real-world biomedical problems. 

My interests range from the intersection of Bayesian inference and deep learning (such as incorporating prior knowledge and structure within deep neural networks, *multi-task/meta-learning* etc) to research towards *trustworthy* ML for biomedical applications. 

During my PhD, I developed extensions of [Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/martens19a.html) and [Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03462) with the goal to enable certain notions of [feature-level interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14293) for the analysis of high-dimensional tabular data. 
More recently, I have been working on the identification of rare clusters, as well as developing targeted data augmentations to ensure fairness across demographic subpopulations. 

Prior to my PhD, I studied for BSc and MSc at the University of Tartu in Estonia, where I worked on statistical modelling in genomics under the supervision of [Raivo Kolde](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IYhbHFMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Leopold Parts](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/parts-leopold).
