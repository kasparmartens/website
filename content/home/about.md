I am a Machine Learning researcher with 10+ years of experience developing innovative AI/ML methods with demonstrated impact in both foundational research and real-world applications. With a background in probabilistic deep learning, my expertise spans generative models, **Large Language Models** (LLMs), and multimodal learning. Currently, I am a Research Scientist at [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/), where I focus on leveraging **LLMs** and **LLM agents** for **scientific discovery in biology**. My recent work explores how LLMs can drive progress in cell perturbation modeling and contribute to the broader goal of building **virtual cells**. 

I did my PhD in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, as part of the [OxCSML](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) group in the Department of Statistics, where I was supervised by [Christopher Yau](http://cwcyau.github.io/) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). Upon graduation, I had an opportunity to continue working with the [Apple](https://www.apple.com/by/ios/health/) ï£¿ Health AI team, as well as spend some time in academia, in [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (as a recipient of the *Turing-Crick Biomedical Data Science Award*) and the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/) in Oxford.  

**News**: 

* See our preprint [SynthPert](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.25346) on enhancing LLM biological reasoning via synthetic reasoning traces
* Our work [LangPert: LLM-Driven Contextual Synthesis for Unseen Perturbation Prediction](https://openreview.net/forum?id=Tmx4o3Jg55) was selected for an Oral Presentation at the [MLGenX workshop](https://mlgenx.github.io/index.html) at ICLR 2025
