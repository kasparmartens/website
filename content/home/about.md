# About me

I am a PhD student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, as part of the [OxCSML](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) group in the Department of Statistics. I am supervised by [Christopher Yau](http://cwcyau.github.io/) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). 

I have a broad interest in statistical machine learning and Bayesian inference techniques with a focus on tackling real problems in genomics and healthcare. 
My PhD research focuses on developing probabilistic latent variable models (such as Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models and Variational AutoEncoders) with applications to biomedical data. 

I am also enthusiastic about R and data visualisation, and I co-organise the [Oxford R user group](https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group/?_cookie-check=YjefwQo7hibpOazc) meetups. Additionally, in my research I like to make use of automatic differentiation frameworks (such as TensorFlow and PyTorch) and I am enthusiastic about probabilistic programming frameworks (such as Stan, PyMC3, or Edward). 

Prior to the PhD, I studied for BSc and MSc at the University of Tartu in Estonia. There I was part of the BIIT research group at the Institute of Computer Science, where I worked on statistical modelling in genomics under the supervision of [Raivo Kolde](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IYhbHFMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Leopold Parts](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/parts-leopold).
