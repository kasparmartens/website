I am a Machine Learning researcher passionate about creating novel AI/ML methods that drive advances in biological sciences and improve human health. I am a Research Scientist at [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/), where I am currently working on building **virtual cell** models and leveraging **LLM agents** for scientific discovery. 

I did my PhD in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, as part of the [OxCSML](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) group in the Department of Statistics, where I was supervised by [Christopher Yau](http://cwcyau.github.io/) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). 
Upon graduation, I had an opportunity to continue working with the [Apple](https://www.apple.com/by/ios/health/) ï£¿ Health AI team, as well as spend some time in academia, in [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (as a recipient of the *Turing-Crick Biomedical Data Science Award*) and the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/) in Oxford.  

**News**: I will be presenting our work ["Enhancing generative perturbation models with LLM-informed gene embeddings"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=eb3ndUlkt4) at the [MLGenX workshop](https://mlgenx.github.io/index.html) at ICLR 2024
