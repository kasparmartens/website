# About me

I am a PhD student in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, as part of the [OxCSML](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) group in the Department of Statistics. I am supervised by [Christopher Yau](http://cwcyau.github.io/) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). 

I have a broad interest in statistical machine learning and Bayesian inference techniques with a focus on tackling real problems in genomics and healthcare. 
My recent PhD research focuses on enabling interpretability within non-linear latent variable models (such as Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models and Variational Autoencoders). 

I am also enthusiastic about R and data visualisation, and I co-organise the [Oxford R user group](https://www.meetup.com/Oxford-R-User-Group/?_cookie-check=YjefwQo7hibpOazc) meetups. 

Prior to the PhD, I studied for BSc and MSc at the University of Tartu in Estonia. There I was part of the BIIT research group at the Institute of Computer Science, where I worked on statistical modelling in genomics under the supervision of [Raivo Kolde](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=IYhbHFMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Leopold Parts](http://www.sanger.ac.uk/people/directory/parts-leopold).
