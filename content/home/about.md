I am a Machine Learning researcher, passionate about creating **novel AI/ML methods** that would make a **real impact** towards advancing our understanding of biological sciences and  improving human health. I am currently a Research Scientist at [Novo Nordisk](https://www.novonordisk.com/). 

I did my PhD in Statistical Machine Learning at the University of Oxford, as part of the [OxCSML](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/) group in the Department of Statistics, where I was supervised by [Christopher Yau](http://cwcyau.github.io/) and [Chris Holmes](http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/~cholmes/). 
Upon graduation, I had an opportunity to continue working with the [Apple](https://www.apple.com/by/ios/health/) ï£¿ Health AI team, as well as spend some time in academia, in [the Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) (as a recipient of the *Turing-Crick Biomedical Data Science Award*) and the [Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk/) in Oxford.  


### Research interests

I have a broad interest in developing **generative models** with a focus on tackling real-world biomedical problems. 

My interests range from the intersection of Bayesian inference and deep learning (such as incorporating prior knowledge and structure within deep neural networks, *multi-task/meta-learning* etc) to research towards *trustworthy* ML for biomedical applications. 

My [PhD thesis](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:36cdd6fa-fec1-44ca-9f0f-876bee7783d6) focused on extensions of deep generative models, from [Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/martens19a.html) to [Variational Autoencoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.03462), with the goal to enable certain notions of [feature-level interpretability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14293) for the analysis of high-dimensional tabular data. 

**News**: I will be presenting our work **"Enhancing generative perturbation models with LLM-informed gene embeddings"** at the [MLGenX workshop](https://mlgenx.github.io/index.html) at ICLR 2024
